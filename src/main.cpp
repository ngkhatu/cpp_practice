// a nested class does not have access to the this pointer of the outer
// (containing) class, so nested classes can not directly access the members of
// the outer class. This is because a nested class can be instantiated
// independently of the outer class (and in such a case, there would be no outer
// class members to access!)

// because nested classes are members of the outer class, they can access any
// private members of the outer class that are in scope.

// There is one case where nested classes are more commonly used. In the
// standard library, most iterator classes are implemented as nested classes of
// the container they are designed to iterate over. For example,
// std::string::iterator is implemented as a nested class of std::string
