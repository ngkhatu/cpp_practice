# Printing inherited classes using operator<<

Consider the following program that makes use of a virtual function:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Base
{
public:
	virtual void print() const { std::cout << "Base";  }
};

class Derived : public Base
{
public:
	void print() const override { std::cout << "Derived"; }
};

int main()
{
	Derived d{};
	Base& b{ d };
	b.print(); // will call Derived::print()

	return 0;
}
```

By now, you should be comfortable with the fact that b.print() will call Derived::print() (because b is referencing a Derived class object, Base::print() is a virtual function, and Derived::print() is an override).

While calling member functions like this to do output is okay, this style of function doesn’t mix well with std::cout:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	Derived d{};
	Base& b{ d };

	std::cout << "b is a ";
	b.print(); // messy, we have to break our print statement to call this function
	std::cout << '\n';

	return 0;
}
```

In this lesson, we’ll look at how to override operator<< for classes using inheritance, so that we can use operator<< as expected, like this:

```cpp
std::cout << "b is a " << b << '\n'; // much better
```

## The challenges with operator<<
Let’s start by overloading operator<< in the typical way:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Base
{
public:
	virtual void print() const { std::cout << "Base"; }

	friend std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& out, const Base& b)
	{
		out << "Base";
		return out;
	}
};

class Derived : public Base
{
public:
	void print() const override { std::cout << "Derived"; }

	friend std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& out, const Derived& d)
	{
		out << "Derived";
		return out;
	}
};

int main()
{
	Base b{};
	std::cout << b << '\n';

	Derived d{};
	std::cout << d << '\n';

	return 0;
}
/*
Because there is no need for virtual function resolution here, this program works as we’d expect, and prints:

Base
Derived
*/
```

Now, consider the following main() function instead:

```cpp
int main()
{
    Derived d{};
    Base& bref{ d };
    std::cout << bref << '\n';

    return 0;
}
/* This program prints:
Base */
```

That’s probably not what we were expecting. This happens because our version of operator<< that handles Base objects isn’t virtual, so std::cout << bref calls the version of operator<< that handles Base objects rather than Derived objects.

Therein lies the challenge.

## Can we make operator<< virtual?
If this issue is that operator<< isn’t virtual, can’t we simply make it virtual?

The short answer is no. There are a number of reasons for this.



First, only member functions can be virtualized -- this makes sense, since only classes can inherit from other classes, and there’s no way to override a function that lives outside of a class (you can overload non-member functions, but not override them). Because we typically implement operator<< as a friend, and friends aren’t considered member functions, a friend version of operator<< is ineligible to be virtualized. (For a review of why we implement operator<< this way, please revisit lesson 21.5 -- Overloading operators using member functions).

Second, even if we could virtualize operator<< there’s the problem that the function parameters for Base::operator<< and Derived::operator<< differ (the Base version would take a Base parameter and the Derived version would take a Derived parameter). Consequently, the Derived version wouldn’t be considered an override of the Base version, and thus be ineligible for virtual function resolution.

So what’s a programmer to do?

## A solution
The answer, as it turns out, is surprisingly simple.

First, we set up operator<< as a friend in our base class as usual. But rather than have operator<< determine what to print, we will instead have it call a normal member function that can be virtualized! This virtual function will do the work of determining what to print for each class.


In this first solution, our virtual member function (which we call identify()) returns a std::string, which is printed by Base::operator<<:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Base
{
public:
	// Here's our overloaded operator<<
	friend std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& out, const Base& b)
	{
		// Call virtual function identify() to get the string to be printed
		out << b.identify();
		return out;
	}

	// We'll rely on member function identify() to return the string to be printed
	// Because identify() is a normal member function, it can be virtualized
	virtual std::string identify() const
	{
		return "Base";
	}
};

class Derived : public Base
{
public:
	// Here's our override identify() function to handle the Derived case
	std::string identify() const override
	{
		return "Derived";
	}
};

int main()
{
	Base b{};
	std::cout << b << '\n';

	Derived d{};
	std::cout << d << '\n'; // note that this works even with no operator<< that explicitly handles Derived objects

	Base& bref{ d };
	std::cout << bref << '\n';

	return 0;
}
/* This prints the expected result:

Base
Derived
Derived */
```

Let’s examine how this works in more detail.

In the case of Base b, operator<< is called with parameter b referencing the Base object. Virtual function call b.identify() thus resolves to Base::identify(), which returns “Base” to be printed. Nothing too special here.

In the case of Derived d, the compiler first looks to see if there’s an operator<< that takes a Derived object. There isn’t one, because we didn’t define one. Next the compiler looks to see if there’s an operator<< that takes a Base object. There is, so the compiler does an implicit upcast of our Derived object to a Base& and calls the function (we could have done this upcast ourselves, but the compiler is helpful in this regard). Because parameter b is referencing a Derived object, virtual function call b.identify() resolves to Derived::identify(), which returns “Derived” to be printed.


Note that we don’t need to define an operator<< for each derived class! The version that handles Base objects works just fine for both Base objects and any class derived from Base!

The third case proceeds as a mix of the first two. First, the compiler matches variable bref with operator<< that takes a Base reference. Because parameter b is referencing a Derived object, b.identify() resolves to Derived::identify(), which returns “Derived”.

Problem solved.

## A more flexible solution
The above solution works great, but has two potential shortcomings:

1. It makes the assumption that the desired output can be represented as a single std::string.
2. Our identify() member function does not have access to the stream object.

The latter is problematic in cases where we need a stream object, such as when we want to print the value of a member variable that has an overloaded operator<<.

Fortunately, it’s straightforward to modify the above example to resolve both of these issues. In the previous version, virtual function identify() returned a string to be printed by Base::operator<<. In this version, we’ll instead define virtual member function print() and delegate responsibility for printing directly to that function.


Here’s an example that illustrates the idea:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Base
{
public:
	// Here's our overloaded operator<<
	friend std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& out, const Base& b)
	{
		// Delegate printing responsibility for printing to virtual member function print()
		return b.print(out);
	}

	// We'll rely on member function print() to do the actual printing
	// Because print() is a normal member function, it can be virtualized
	virtual std::ostream& print(std::ostream& out) const
	{
		out << "Base";
		return out;
	}
};

// Some class or struct with an overloaded operator<<
struct Employee
{
	std::string name{};
	int id{};

	friend std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& out, const Employee& e)
	{
		out << "Employee(" << e.name << ", " << e.id << ")";
		return out;
	}
};

class Derived : public Base
{
private:
	Employee m_e{}; // Derived now has an Employee member

public:
	Derived(const Employee& e)
		: m_e{ e }
	{
	}

	// Here's our override print() function to handle the Derived case
	std::ostream& print(std::ostream& out) const override
	{
		out << "Derived: ";

		// Print the Employee member using the stream object
		out << m_e;

		return out;
	}
};

int main()
{
	Base b{};
	std::cout << b << '\n';

	Derived d{ Employee{"Jim", 4}};
	std::cout << d << '\n'; // note that this works even with no operator<< that explicitly handles Derived objects

	Base& bref{ d };
	std::cout << bref << '\n';

	return 0;
}
/* This outputs:

Base
Derived: Employee(Jim, 4)
Derived: Employee(Jim, 4) */
```

In this version, Base::operator<< doesn’t do any printing itself. Instead, it just calls virtual member function print() and passes it the stream object. The print() function then uses this stream object to do its own printing. Base::print() uses the stream object to print “Base”. More interestingly, Derived::print() uses the stream object to print both “Derived: ” and to call Employee::operator<< to print the value of member m_e. The latter would have been more challenging to do in the prior example!
